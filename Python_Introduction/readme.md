## 🔹 Study Plan

| Lecture | Duration      | Topics                      | Exercises / Projects                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0       | 00:00 – 01:50 | Functions, Variables        | Write simple Python functions and practice variable assignments                      |
| 1       | 01:50 – 02:46 | Conditionals                | Practice `if/elif/else` statements; mini project: a basic quiz program               |
| 2       | 02:46 – 04:07 | Loops                       | `for` and `while` loops; mini project: number guessing game                          |
| 3       | 04:07 – 04:51 | Exceptions                  | Handle invalid user input; practice with `try/except`                                |
| 4       | 04:51 – 06:09 | Libraries                   | Use `math`, `random`, and third-party libraries like `requests`                      |
| 5       | 06:09 – 07:00 | Unit Tests                  | Write tests using `unittest` or `pytest`                                             |
| 6       | 07:00 – 08:32 | File I/O                    | Read and write files; mini project: CSV data processing                              |
| 7       | 08:32 – 10:37 | Regular Expressions         | Validate emails, phone numbers, etc.                                                 |
| 8       | 10:37 – 13:28 | Object-Oriented Programming | Classes, methods, inheritance; mini project: bank account simulation                 |
| 9       | 13:28 – End   | Et Cetera                   | Combine everything into a final project; explore APIs, web apps, or cloud deployment |

> **Tip:** After each lecture, complete exercises and experiment with small programs to reinforce learning.

## 🔹 Recommended Practice

1. **Mini Projects:**

   * To-do list CLI app
   * Number guessing game
   * File parser (CSV or JSON)
   * Simple class-based simulation (bank, library, or game)
