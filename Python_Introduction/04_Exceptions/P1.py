# In this topic, we will focus on errors — the things that prevent our program from running properly.
# An error is a problem that stops your code from executing.
# There are mainly two types of errors:

# 1) Syntax Error:
#    - Occurs when you write code that doesn't follow Python's rules or structure.
#    - Example: missing colon, wrong indentation, unmatched parentheses, etc.

# 2) Runtime Error (Exception):
#    - Occurs when the code is syntactically correct but causes an error while running.
#    - Example: dividing by zero, using a variable that hasn’t been defined(Accept outside of for loop), etc.
